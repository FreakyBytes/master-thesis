  abstract = {Flow monitoring has become a prevalent method for monitoring traffic in high-speed networks. By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of deep packet inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.},

  abstract = {Building automation systems are traditionally concerned with the control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, as well as lighting and shading, systems. They have their origin in a time where security has been considered as a side issue at best. Nowadays, with the rising desire to integrate security-critical services that were formerly provided by isolated subsystems, security must no longer be neglected. Thus, the development of a comprehensive security concept is of utmost importance. This paper starts with a security threat analysis and identifies the challenges of providing security in the building automation domain. Afterward, the security mechanisms of available standards are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, two approaches that provide both secure communication and secure execution of possibly untrusted control applications are presented.},

  abstract = {Building automation systems (BAS) provide automatic control of the conditions of indoor environments. The historical root and still core domain of BAS is the automation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in large functional buildings. Their primary goal is to realize significant savings in energy and reduce cost. Yet the reach of BAS has extended to include information from all kinds of building systems, working toward the goal of "intelligent buildings". Since these systems are diverse by tradition, integration issues are of particular importance. When compared with the field of industrial automation, building automation exhibits specific, differing characteristics. The present paper introduces the task of building automation and the systems and communications infrastructure necessary to address it. Basic requirements are covered as well as standard application models and typical services. An overview of relevant standards is given, including BACnet, LonWorks and EIB/KNX as open systems of key significance in the building automation domain.},

  abstract = {During the design of large technical systems, the use of analytic and simulative models to test and dimension the system before implementation is of practical importance for an efficient and reliable design process. However, setting up the necessary models is time-consuming and therefore often too expensive in practice. Usually most information for modeling is already available in the design tool used to develop such extensive systems and only needs to be extracted for automatic model building. This paper presents an automated modeling approach from an existing design database using the example of a network analysis for building automation fieldbuses. The analysis is based on an analytical decomposition approach that enables fast estimation of performance measures for large-scale networks. The combination of fast analytical algorithms with automatic model generation allows network performance engineering with minimized effort for model generation and analysis.},

  abstract = {Extending the narrow scope of building management systems to form the ‘intelligent building’ has led to the widespread use of proprietary ‘enterprise’ software platforms and networks in both monitoring and control. The PC user is only too familiar with the vulnerability of networked computers to malicious software. But it is only recently that attention has been paid to the possibility of virus damage to process controllers. The hazard for ‘building management systems’ functionality is real but the risk is difficult to assess. Pressures on system procurement and upgrades aimed at improving functionality bring with them increased exposure to the probability of a successful attack. Most published security protocols may engender a false sense of security. The key defence is to ensure a ‘fall-back’, ‘black start’, ‘dumb capability’ within the intelligent building.},

We detail the threat model under consideration, identifying the security desiderata and propose a secure communication protocol, together with a new distributed key agreement scheme.

  abstract = {While there is a broad corpus of security intelligence technologies and solutions for IT (information technology) networks, only moderate experience and investment exists in applying security intelligence approaches to OT (operational technology) networks. OT networks have traditionally been isolated from IT networks, and therefore, security has been of minor concern. Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data. The techniques have been developed for protecting SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems and have been validated in an industrial cyber security testing laboratory.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for a flow-based network traffic monitoring of building automation and control networks. Current approaches to monitor special environment networks are limited to checking accessibility and a state of monitored devices. On the other hand, current generation of flow-based network monitoring tools focuses only on the IP traffic. These tools do not allow to observe special protocols used, for example, in an intelligent building network. We present a novel approach based on processing of flow information from such special environment. To demonstrate capabilities of such approach and to provide characteristics of a large building automation network, we present measurement results from Masaryk University Campus.},

  abstract = {Traffic measurement often focuses on measuring traffic at various granularities. Our paper considers an approach that generalizes previous solutions: we define a traffic cluster to consist of all traffic that matches a specified set of values for certain header fields. While existing technology (e.g., Cisco ACLs) allows managers to measure specific traffic clusters, this requires a priori knowledge of what traffic clusters are worth watching. The main contribution of this paper is to suggest that automatically identifying and measuring high volume traffic clusters provides useful traffic reports to network managers without a priori knowledge.},

  abstract = {Advanced networking technology and increasing information services have led to extensive interconnection between Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks and Internet. The connection to Internet and public networks massively elevates the risk of the BAC networks being attacked. In this paper, we present a framework for a rule based anomaly detection of Building Automation and Control networks. We develop an anomaly based intrusion detection system to the building network by training the system with dataflows that are dynamically captured from the Fire Alarm System testbed using the BACnet Protocol Monitoring module. The rules acquired from the offline data mining procedure can detect attacks against the BACnet protocol with an extremely low false positive rate. We evaluate our approach by launching several attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of the BACnet Protocol. A classification of detected attacks is introduced at the end.},

In recent years building automation systems are commonly used to allow better comfort for the occupants, and also to improve security in the building. This paper describes an approach for improving energy efficiency in private and business buildings by utilizing building automation systems. The goal of the approach is to provide an intelligent system that can help the occupants to monitor and control their energy consumption and also to notice their energy saving potentials. This paper also introduces method of knowledge-driven energy analysis that offers more intelligent mechanism as improvement of classical data-driven analysis, which is commonly used by existing energy analysis solutions.},
