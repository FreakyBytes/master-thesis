The proposed approach follows physical structure of building as a starting point for its automation software development. The architecture proposed enables simulation in the loop with plant model that can be created without extra development efforts. The decentralized control logics of the BMS subsystems can be developed independently from the deployment configurations thanks to the properties of IEC 61499 reference architecture.},

The PC user is only too familiar with the vulnerability of networked computers to malicious software. But it is only recently that attention has been paid to the possibility of virus damage to process controllers. The hazard for `building management systems' functionality is real but the risk is difficult to assess. Pressures on system procurement and upgrades aimed at improving functionality bring with them increased exposure to the probability of a successful attack. Most published security protocols may engender a false sense of security. The key defence is to ensure a `fall-back', `black start', `dumb capability' within the intelligent building.},

However, setting up the necessary models is time-consuming and therefore often too expensive in practice. Usually most information for modeling is already available in the design tool used to develop such extensive systems and only needs to be extracted for automatic model building. This paper presents an automated modeling approach from an existing design database using the example of a network analysis for building automation fieldbuses. The analysis is based on an analytical decomposition approach that enables fast estimation of performance measures for large-scale networks. The combination of fast analytical algorithms with automatic model generation allows network performance engineering with minimized effort for model generation and analysis.},

The historical root and still core domain of BAS is the automation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in large functional buildings. Their primary goal is to realize significant savings in energy and reduce cost. Yet the reach of BAS has extended to include information from all kinds of building systems, working toward the goal of "intelligent buildings". Since these systems are diverse by tradition, integration issues are of particular importance. When compared with the field of industrial automation, building automation exhibits specific, differing characteristics. The present paper introduces the task of building automation and the systems and communications infrastructure necessary to address it. Basic requirements are covered as well as standard application models and typical services. An overview of relevant standards is given, including BACnet, LonWorks and EIB/KNX as open systems of key significance in the building automation domain.},

They have their origin in a time where security has been considered as a side issue at best. Nowadays, with the rising desire to integrate security-critical services that were formerly provided by isolated subsystems, security must no longer be neglected. Thus, the development of a comprehensive security concept is of utmost importance. This paper starts with a security threat analysis and identifies the challenges of providing security in the building automation domain. Afterward, the security mechanisms of available standards are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, two approaches that provide both secure communication and secure execution of possibly untrusted control applications are presented.},

  abstract = {Flow monitoring has become a prevalent method for monitoring traffic in high-speed networks. By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of deep packet inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.},

  abstract = {Advanced networking technology and increasing information services have led to extensive interconnection between Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks and Internet. The connection to Internet and public networks massively elevates the risk of the BAC networks being attacked. In this paper, we present a framework for a rule based anomaly detection of Building Automation and Control networks. We develop an anomaly based intrusion detection system to the building network by training the system with dataflows that are dynamically captured from the Fire Alarm System testbed using the BACnet Protocol Monitoring module. The rules acquired from the offline data mining procedure can detect attacks against the BACnet protocol with an extremely low false positive rate. We evaluate our approach by launching several attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of the BACnet Protocol. A classification of detected attacks is introduced at the end.},

  abstract = {While there is a broad corpus of security intelligence technologies and solutions for IT (information technology) networks, only moderate experience and investment exists in applying security intelligence approaches to OT (operational technology) networks. OT networks have traditionally been isolated from IT networks, and therefore, security has been of minor concern. Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data. The techniques have been developed for protecting SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems and have been validated in an industrial cyber security testing laboratory.},

This training data is typically expensive to produce. Moreover, these methods have difficulty in detecting new types of attack. Using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, however, the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously "unseen" attacks. In this paper, we present a new density-based and grid-based clustering algorithm that is suitable for unsupervised anomaly detection. We evaluated our methods using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. Our evaluation shows that the accuracy of our approach is close to that of existing techniques reported in the literature, and has several advantages in terms of computational complexity.},

Outliers are those points having the largest values of weight. In order to compute these weights, we find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a fast and efficient way by linearizing the search space through the Hilbert space filling curve. The algorithm consists of two phases, the first provides an approximated solution, within a small factor, after executing at most d + 1 scans of the data set with a low time complexity cost, where d is the number of dimensions of the data set. During each scan the number of points candidate to belong to the solution set is sensibly reduced. The second phase returns the exact solution by doing a single scan which examines further a little fraction of the data set. Experimental results show that the algorithm always finds the exact solution during the first phase after d- $\ElsevierGlyph{300A}$ d + 1 steps and it scales linearly both in the dimensionality and the size of the data set.},

Outliers arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used, drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics.

The second tier is a traditional anomaly detection algorithm, whose efficiency is improved by the availability of data on the packet payload content.},

During the tree building process, densities for the outlier class are used directly in the split point determination algorithm. No artificial counter-examples have to be sampled from the unknown class, which yields to more precise decision boundaries and a deterministic classification result. Furthermore, the prior of the outlier class can be used to adjust the sensitivity of the anomaly detector. The proposed method combines the advantages of classification trees with the benefit of a more accurate representation of the outliers. For evaluation, we compare our approach with other state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on four standard data sets including the KDD-Cup 99. The results show that the proposed method performs as well as more complex approaches and is even superior on three out of four data sets.},

The Maximum Entropy technique provides a flexible and fast approach to estimate the baseline distribution, which also gives the network administrator a multi-dimensional view of the network traffic. By computing a measure related to the relative entropy of the network traffic under observation with respect to the baseline distribution, we are able to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. In addition, our method provides information revealing the type of the anomaly detected. It requires a constant memory and a computation time proportional to the traffic rate.},

This gave rise to a new class of theoretically elegant learning machines that use a central concept of SVMs-kernels--for a number of learning tasks. Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. Learning with Kernels provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years.},

The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

Currently it is once again an active research area after some years of relative neglect, and recent work has solved a number of old problems in outlier theory, and identified new ones. The major results are, however, scattered amongst many journal articles, and for some time there has been a clear need to bring them together in one place. That was the original intention of this monograph: but during execution it became clear that the existing theory of outliers was deficient in several areas, and so the monograph also contains a number of new results and conjectures. In view of the enormous volume ofliterature on the outlier problem and its cousins, no attempt has been made to make the coverage exhaustive. The material is concerned almost entirely with the use of outlier tests that are known (or may reasonably be expected) to be optimal in some way. Such topics as robust estimation are largely ignored, being covered more adequately in other sources. The numerous ad hoc statistics proposed in the early work on the grounds of intuitive appeal or computational simplicity also are not discussed in any detail.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been much interest in applying data mining to computer network intrusion detection. For the past two years, MITRE has been exploring how to make data mining useful in this context. This paper provides lessons learned in this task. Based upon our experiences in getting started on this type of project, we suggest data mining techniques to consider and types of expertise and infrastructure needed. This paper has two intended audiences: network security professionals with little background in data mining, and data mining experts with little background in network intrusion detection. Key words: data mining, intrusion detection, computer network security 1. Network Intrusion Detection: What is it? Intrusion detection starts with instrumentation of a computer network for data collection. Pattern-based software `sensors ' monitor the network traffic and raise `alarms ' when the traffic matches a saved pattern. Security analysts decide whether these alarms indicate an event serious enough to warrant a response. A response might be to shut down a part of the network, to phone the internet service provider associated with suspicious traffic, or to simply make note of unusual traffic for future reference. If the network is small and signatures are kept up to date, the human analyst solution to intrusion detection works well. But when organizations have a large, complex network the human analysts quickly become overwhelmed by the number of alarms they need to review. The sensors on the MITRE network, for example, currently generate over one million alarms per day. And that number is increasing. This situation arises from ever increasing attacks on the network, as well as a tendency for sensor patterns to be insufficiently selective (i.e., raise too many false alarms). Commercial tools typically do not provide an enterprise level view of alarms generated by multiple sensor vendors. Commercial intrusion detection software packages tend to be signature-oriented with little or no state information maintained. These limitations led us to investigate the application of data mining to this problem.},

Several existing supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection schemes and their variations are evaluated on the DARPA 1998 data set of network connections [9] as well as on real network data using existing standard evaluation techniques as well as using several specific metrics that are appropriate when detecting attacks that involve a large number of connections.

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

  abstract = {The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is a very powerful anomaly detection method available in machine learning and classification. The algorithm defines the notion of local outlier in which the degree to which an object is outlying is dependent on the density of its local neighborhood, and each object can be assigned an LOF which represents the likelihood of that object being an outlier. Although this concept of a local outlier is a useful one, the computation of LOF values for every data object requires a large number of k-nearest neighbor queries -- this overhead can limit the use of LOF due to the computational overhead involved. Due to the growing popularity of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) in general-purpose computing domains, and equipped with a high-level programming language designed specifically for general-purpose applications (e.g., CUDA), we look to apply this parallel computing approach to accelerate LOF. In this paper we explore how to utilize a CUDA-based GPU implementation of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to accelerate LOF classification. We achieve more than a 100X speedup over a multi-threaded dual-core CPU implementation. We also consider the impact of input data set size, the neighborhood size (i.e., the value of k) and the feature space dimension, and report on their impact on execution time.},

We show that under a broad set of conditions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10\textendash{}15 dimensions.These results should not be interpreted to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying some high-dimensional workloads for which this effect does not occur. However, our results do emphasize that the methodology used almost universally in the database literature to evaluate high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and should be modified. In particular, most such techniques proposed in the literature are not evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor is not meaningful. Often, even the reported experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that linear scan would outperform the techniques being proposed on the workloads studied in high (10\textendash{}15) dimensionality!},

  abstract = {The information entropy in information theory, developed by Shannon, gives an effective measure of uncertainty for a given system. And it also seems a competing mechanism for the measurement of uncertainty in rough sets. Many researchers have applied the information entropy to rough sets, and proposed different information entropy models in rough sets. Especially, D{\"u}ntsch et al. presented a well-justified information entropy model for the measurement of uncertainty in rough sets. In this paper, we shall demonstrate the application of this model for the study of a specific data mining problem \textendash{} outlier detection. By virtue of D{\"u}ntsch's information entropy model, we propose a novel definition of outliers \textendash{} IE (information entropy)-based outliers in rough sets. An algorithm to find such outliers is also given. And the effectiveness of IE-based method for outlier detection is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets.},

  abstract = {In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now. To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.},
