Despite being widely used and applied in \gls{ip} networks \parencite[cf.][pp.~201~ff.]{Northcutt2005}, \gls{ids} seem rather seldom utilized to monitor \glspl{bas}.
However, there are a few examples in literature where the principles of \glspl{ids} are applied to \gls{scada} and \gls{ics}.

One example of deploying anomaly in \gls{scada} networks is presented by \textcite{Yang2006}, with the base assumption that a security violation changes the system behaviour and that this change can be detected. They argue, that the repeatable and predictable nature of traffic in \gls{scada} networks make them a application field for anomaly detection based \glspl{ids}, opposed to rule based.
Further, they focus on inside threads where the attacker already has gained access and some knowledge about the targeted systems and possible vulnerabilities.
The proposed method is to use a \gls{aakr} model for anomaly detection, to predict \emph{corrected} versions of their selected traffic features. Then the binary hypothesis technique \gls{sprt} was applied, to determine if the observed sequence was likely to be generated by normal behaviour or not.
\textcite{Yang2006} show, that using \gls{aakr} with \gls{sprt} anomalies can identify malicious traffic in \gls{scada} networks, however they also note that it is crucial to monitor a large variety of system measurements and it is therefore an important task to carefully determine which variables are of value and which are not.
