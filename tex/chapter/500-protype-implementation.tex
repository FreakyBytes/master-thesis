\begin{itemize}
	\item implementation in \gls{py} 3
	\item command line interface with subcommand as central entrypoint providing configuration and log management
	\item each process is run as separate processes to mitigate \gls{gil} limitations
	\item process has one task (agent simulator, collector, analyser module)
	\item modules/process pass messages mainly using \gls{amqp} and \gls{rabbitmq} as message broker
	\item reusing \gls{influxdb} and \gls{rabbitmq} by separating pipelines using a project name
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Command Line Interface}
\label{sec:impl:cli}

\begin{itemize}
	\item central entry point for all operations
	\item consistent user experience -> less fiddling while debugging/developing
	\item centralises configuration and log setup
	\item can be easily made accessible via python setuptools
		\subitem if globally installed, callable via normal terminal command
	\item implemented using the \gls{lib-click} library version 6
\end{itemize}

\section{The Agent Simulator}
\label{sec:impl:agent}

\begin{itemize}
	\item simulates multiple agents based of one log containing telegram in raw \gls{baos} format. cf. Appendix~\todo{add log sample in appendix}
	\item log must be in chronological order
	\item utilizes own parser implementation \url{https://github.com/FreakyBytes/BaosKnxParser}
	\item different agents can be simulated by applying filter rules to log stream, defining, what each agent "can see"
	\item is supposed to replace actual agents during development
		\subitem repeatable data
		\subitem easy/fast setup
		\subitem log-time much faster than real-time
		\subitem load testing possible
	\item reads in individual pack
	\item filters according to agent filter rules
	\item updates agent-specific window data model
	\item if window length/timeout (cf. Section~\ref{sec:concept:agent}) is exceeded in log-time, windows are submitted to \gls{amqp} message broker (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:concept:architecture})
	\item runs until log is fully red, or maximum packets to parse are exceeded, or defined end timestamp is reached
\end{itemize}

\section{The Collector Module}
\label{sec:impl:collector}

\begin{itemize}
	\item central hub for relaying information
	\item receives agent windows via \gls{amqp} message broker (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:concept:architecture})
	\item subscribed to the agent topic using \gls{lib-pika} version 0.11
	\item
