Using the concepts described in Chapter~\ref{sec:concept}, a prototype was implemented to validate, test and proof it which is described in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl}.
In this Chapter this implementation shall be used to conduct a performance experiment on the implementation itself and the used algorithms.
For which first the experiment setup is described.
