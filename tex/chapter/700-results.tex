Using the concepts described in Chapter~\ref{sec:concept}, a prototype was implemented to validate, test and proof it which is described in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl}.
In this Chapter this implementation shall be used to conduct a performance experiment on the implementation itself and the used algorithms.
For which first the experiment setup is described.

\section{Conducting the Performance Experiment}
\label{sec:results:experiment}

The in this thesis proposed concept for an online anomaly-based \gls{ids} tailored to \glspl{bas} was implemented as prototype, as described in Chapter~\ref{sec:impl}.
Using this prototype a full analysis pipeline was setup, which included the Collector, all four Analyser modules, and the Simulated Agent, as well as \gls{rabbitmq} as message broker and \gls{influxdb} as persistent data storage.
The Simulated Agent was used to inject prior recorded traffic into the system faster than real time.
The data was originally recorded between 2017-01-21 and 2017-02-21 on the third floor of the computer science building of the University Rostock.
Before injecting and analysing the data, it was then split into three parts. The first two weeks are dedicated to train the base-line models for the Analyser modules. The following week was used as validation, to ensure the algorithms are properly fitted to the data. Finally, the last week was modified to contain four scenarios which alter the behaviour of the line, as described in Section~\ref{sec:methods:gen-test}.
\newpage
These modifications are meant to resemble plausible attacks on \gls{bas} networks and therefore include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Injecting unusual network traffic by copying traffic from another day and time
	\item Performing a \gls{dos} attack
	\item Scanning all addresses of the network
	\item Introducing two new devices
\end{enumerate}

First, only the training data was imported via the Simulated Agent and pushed to the \gls{influxdb} by the Collector. This data was then used to train the different algorithms.
Then the remaining two parts of data set were imported via the Simulated Agent and processed into statistical windows, these were then processed by the Collector, and relayed to the analytical modules. Finally, the Analyser compare the incoming windows to the base-line model and store the result in the \gls{influxdb}. From there the monitoring and alerting software \gls{grafana} can query the results and plot them into dynamic graphs, as well as send alerts based on predefined thresholds or rules.

\section{Experiment Results}
\label{sec:results:results}

Finally, in this section the detection results of the proposed algorithms are examined using the graphs generated with \gls{grafana}. They will be used to determine the quality of the detection results based on five criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item General ability to the detect the attack
	\item Differentiation from background noise of the detection results
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Average difference in detected outliers compared to the validation dataset
		\item Average difference in underlying decision metric compared to the validation dataset
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Response time 
	\item Persistence of detection
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detection of Unusual Network Traffic}
\label{sec:results:results:unusual}

The first modification applied to the test data set was the injection of unusual traffic. 
For this a time span of five hours was replaced with traffic from the same line, but from different weekday and time of the day.
This effectively aims to test the seasonal- or time-sensitivity of the models.

Figure~\ref{fig:results:unusual} shows several metrics from the four different anomaly detection methods.
In \ref{fig:results:unusual:tc} a sudden increase in the observed amounts of telegrams per window is to observe, whereby telegrams with using unknown addresses were observed. This is to be expected since the five hours which replaced the original traffic were taken from the same line but from a more busy point of the week, hence the increase of transmitted telegrams.
The absence of unknown addresses, either as source or as destination, is also clearly indicated by Figure~\ref{fig:results:unusual:addr}.

Surprisingly, there is also no significant increase in the number of detected outliers neither by the \gls{svm}, nor using the \gls{lof}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results:unusual:outlier}.
Even though the \gls{lof} shows an average of $0.77$ outliers, it can hardly be considered an significant increase when compared to the surrounding unmodified data and to the validation data set in Appendix~\ref{app:metrics:validation}.
However, the spread of the \gls{lof} depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:results:unusual:lof} shows a small change downwards, which indicates less normal behaviour -- it is arguably not significant enough.

In contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:results:unusual:svm} even shows that the distance to the decision function of the \gls{svm} even increases positively, which means the analysed points are considered to represent the normality stronger. This is also reflected in the detection of no outliers with the exception of two small peaks.

The Entropy Analyser mostly calculates a entropy of infinity, which is here encoded as $100000$. This results is not limited to the period of the modification and therefore renders its results relatively meaningless.

\subsection{Detection of a DoS Attack}
\label{sec:results:results:dos}

The second modification applied to the test dataset, included a \gls{dos} attack, which flooded the entire line \code{3.4} with \code{A\_Restart} telegrams. As to expect the amount of telegrams with unknown addresses and count of unknown addresses jump right up, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results:dos:tc} and~\ref{fig:results:dos:addr}. This clearly indicates an anomaly, since the threshold for unknown addresses within the network should be set to zero.

Figure~\ref{fig:results:dos:outlier} illustrates, that the \gls{lof} and \gls{svm} outlier detection reacted equally prompt, by both classifying the entire period of the attack as outlier.
This is also reflected by the underlying metrics. The maximum of the \gls{lof} in Figure~\ref{fig:results:dos:lof} stays low during the entire attack. Similarly, the distance to the decision surface of the \gls{svm} resides in the high negatives implying a huge divergence from the normality.
Especially noteworthy is that the spread between minimum and maximum of the Local Outlier Factor as well as the distance to the decision surface falls close to zero during the attack, which indicates a high certainty of the classification.
The premature identification of the anomalies visible in Figure~\ref{fig:results:dos:outliers} could be caused by misalignment and small inaccuracies in the time windowing processes performed by the Collector.

The entropy, plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:results:dos:entropy}, does not change at all, neither during the modification nor outside of it.

\subsection{Detection of a Network Scan}
\label{sec:results:results:scan}

The third modification to be applied to the test dataset was a network scan where the entire \gls{knx} address space was scanned using a management routine every \gls{knx} device must implement. Every present device will respond with an appropriator answer.

Similar to the \gls{dos} attack produces a scan of the entire network significant more traffic than normal operation, which is indicated by Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:tc}. Further a lot of traffic targeting prior unknown addresses is inevitable, causing the Address Analyser to detect such behaviour. (see Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:addr})

In contrast to the clear identification by the Address Analyser stands the \gls{lof} Analyser, which identifies the attack but as outlier in Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:outlier}, but the separation from the background noise is not significant. Similar is to observe in the underlying \gls{lof} metric depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:lof}. However, it is curious that even though the average of the \gls{lof} is stable compared with the surrounding background noise, the spread decreases drastically.

On the other hand, the \gls{svm} identifies the threat flawless. The low background noise and the clear detection as outlier in Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:outlier} allows for a certain identification. This is supported by a sharp drop into the negative of the distance to the decision surface as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results:scan:svm}, distinctly indicating an outlier.

The calculated entropy compared to the training data is continuously infinite, making it unfit to draw any conclusions from.

\end{table}

\subsection{Detection of New Devices}
\label{sec:results:results:newdevice}

The fourth and final modification applied to the test dataset contained two new devices. The required data was taken from the same line, but from a different day, only the date and the source address were altered. This traffic was injected over the whole target day, keeping the frequency of the original traffic.

As traffic resembling an actual \gls{knx} device was injected using prior not used addresses, the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:results:newdevice:tc} shows only small amounts traffic with unknown addresses, when compared to \gls{dos} attacks or network scans.
However, Figure~\ref{fig:results:newdevice:addr} illustrates clearly activity with of unknown devices.
Since the alert threshold for both metrics is zero, an alert would be raised.

Opposed to that are the results of the outlier detection using \gls{lof} and the \gls{svm}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results:newdevice:outlier}.
With only a difference of $0.055$ compared to the validation data set no significant increase in outliers was detected by the \gls{lof} Analyser.
Similarly, the \gls{svm} identified on average $0.005$ outliers over the period of modification, which resembles a drop of $0.002$ when compared to the validation dataset.
Additionally, the spread for both the \gls{lof} and the distance to the decision surface in Figure~\ref{fig:results:newdevice:lof} and~\ref{fig:results:newdevice:svm} is considerably moderate, not indicating a strong tendency to either outlier or inlier.
Therefore, it is to conclude that neither the \gls{lof} nor the \gls{svm} detected this modification.
Although the occurrence of unknown addresses and outliers detected by the \gls{svm} show some timely correlation.

As in the previous modifications, no conclusion can be drawn from the Entropy Analyser as it is continuously detecting an infinite value.

The persistence and response time can not be taken into account for this modification. Even though the modification was applied over the course of the whole day, the device were not sending traffic right from the beginning of the day, therefore not being detectable on any layer above the physical.
