	\subsubsection{Approaches}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item cf. \textcite{Hodge2004}
			\item Type 1: "Determine the outliers with no prior knowledge of the data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "unsupervised clustering" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "assumes that errors or faults are separated from the ‘normal’ data and will thus appear as outliers" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem " predominantly retrospective and is analogous to a batch-processing system" \parencite{Hodge2004} - Requires a bunch of data to begin with
				\subitem " requires that all data be available before processing" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "data is static" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "two sub-techniques" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem -> "outlier diagnostic approach highlights the potential outlying points" \parencite{Hodge2004} and "prune the outliers and fit their system model to the remaining data until no more outliers are detected" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem -> "accommodation that incorporates the outliers into the distribution model generated and employs a robust classification method" \parencite{Hodge2004} which "can withstand outliers in the data and generally induce a boundary of normality around the majority of the data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "Non-robust methods are best suited when there are only a few outliers in the data set" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "a robust method must be used if there are a large number of outliers to prevent this distortion" \parencite{Hodge2004}
			\item Type 2: "Model both normality and abnormality." \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "supervised classification" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "requires pre-labelled data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "The entire area outside the normal class represents the outlier class" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "best suited to static data" \parencite{Hodge2004} "classification needs to be rebuilt from first principles if the data distribution shifts" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "can be used for on-line classification" \parencite{Hodge2004} learning while new samples are classified
				\subitem "require a good spread of both normal and abnormal data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "classification is limited to a ‘known’ distribution" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "cannot always handle outliers from unexpected regions" \parencite{Hodge2004}
			\item Type 3: "Model only normality [...]" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "novelty detection" \parencite{Hodge2004} " semi-supervised recognition or detection task" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "needs pre-classified data but only learns data marked normal" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "suitable for static or dynamic data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "can learn the model incrementally as new data arrives" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "aims to define a boundary of normality" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "requires the full gamut of normality to be available for training to permit generalisation" \parencite{Hodge2004} but "requires no abnormal data" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem this is good, because "Abnormal data is often difficult to obtain or expensive in many fault detection domains [...]" \parencite{Hodge2004}
				\subitem "as long as the new fraud lies outside the boundary of normality then the system will be correctly detect the fraud" \parencite{Hodge2004}

	\subsubsection{Local Outlier Factor}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item seems to be a good fit
			\item works on unclean training data
			\item good selection of vectors and distance functions is required
			\item 11\% of the first 500 telegrams in \verb|eiblog.txt| are considered outliers
			\item density based
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{On Class SVM}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item aka. novelty detection
			\item all training data is considered good
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Isolation Forest}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ...
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Elliptical Envelope}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item tries to fit data to estimated \emph{shape}
			\item does not seem to be a good match, since it required to know the distribution of the vector fields
		\end{itemize}
