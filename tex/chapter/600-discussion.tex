\begin{itemize}
	\item analyser modules only detect relative changes (no absolute packet amount)
		\subitem therefore no detection of increasing/decreasing of baseline traffic
		\subitem therefore no detection of generally more or less normal activity -> possible unable to detect failing lines/devices/etc
		\subitem solved by monitoring absolute amount of packets in \gls{grafana} -> easy solution, no additional impl effort
\end{itemize}
