\begin{itemize}
	\item Errors in handling daylight saving time and time zones, due to missing time zone information in log
		\subitem simulated agent might be a bit off
		\subitem gap plus cummulated packets when daylight saving changes
	\item analyser modules only detect relative changes (no absolute packet amount)
		\subitem therefore no detection of increasing/decreasing of baseline traffic
		\subitem therefore no detection of generally more or less normal activity -> possible unable to detect failing lines/devices/etc
		\subitem solved by monitoring absolute amount of packets in \gls{grafana} -> easy solution, no additional impl effort
	\item in-band telegram from agent to collector contain sensitive information
		\subitem encrypt and sign stats telegrams
		
	\item way the feature vector is build
		\subitem normalising to the maximum within the window
		\subitem instead of normalising against global fix maximum
		\subitem does not compare absolute appearance of features, but rather the composition/structure of traffic
		\subitem too much emphasise on APCI, because large portion of feature vector
		
	\item injecting traffic from other time of the day is not detected.
