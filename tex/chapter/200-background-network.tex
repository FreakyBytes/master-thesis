\begin{itemize}
	\item active
		\begin{itemize}
			\item inject additional traffic to measure things \parencite{Hofstede2014}
			\item e.g. ping, traceroute
		\end{itemize}
	\item passive
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "observe existing traffic as it passes by" \parencite{Hofstede2014}
			\item e.g. packet capture "This method generally provides most insight into the network traffic, as complete packets can be captured and further analyzed. However, in high-speed networks with line rates of up to 100 Gbps, packet capture requires expensive hardware and substantial infrastructure for storage and analysis." \parencite{Hofstede2014}
			\item "Another passive network monitoring approach that is more scalable for use in high-speed networks is flow export, in which packets are aggregated into flows and exported for storage and analysis." \parencite{Hofstede2014}
			\item  "a set of IP packets passing an observation point in the network during a certain time interval, such that all packets belonging to a particular flow have a set of common properties." \parencite{Claise2013}
